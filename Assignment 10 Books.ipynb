    "# Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "It is basially subclass of Filtering System.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is mainly used in e-commerece websites such as Amazon, Flipcart, etc. and other online platforms for webseris like Netflix, Hotstar and even for book reading platforms such as Kindle.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What kind of data do we need for this system ?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We need users purchasing data. Which user has purchased which product.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recommendation system thier are mainly two types of systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collaborative Filtering \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Content-based Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to focus on Collaboraitve Filtering. It means, we want to track or identify who are the similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Defination of Collaborative Filtering:-</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "If person A has the same opinoin as person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue x, when compared to the opinion of a person chosen randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>How do we capture similiarities ?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make a matrix, where users will be rows and the name of the product will be columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The users who have purchased the product will mark the intersection of the the particular user and that particular product as 1, otherwise 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use <b>dot product</b> of matrix, and find the <b>theta</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If value of theta is smaller, that means those two vectors are very close to each other. That means those two user's interest are very similar to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if theta value is more i.e. it is tending towards 90 degree, then that means that the two vectors will be oppopsite of each other, those two users are having totally opposite opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when a new user comes, we will make dot product of that user with every existing user, and we will pick up the highest value. That would be the most similar user. Then the product which existing user has purchased will be recommended to the new user.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>This process is called Collaborative Filtering.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The above vector methods was Cosine-based Similarity.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>There is one more way to find the similarity, Correlation-based Similarity.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simply find out correlation between two users and depending on the sign we will conclude. \n",
    "\n",
    "That sign should be positive only. If negative, then that means interest are opposite. So not usefull for recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Coefficient should be +ve and tending towards 1, i.e. the 2 users are having perfect similar interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Once similar, what item(s) to recommend ?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The item that hasn't been bought by the user yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may create a list of multiple items to be considered for recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally recommend the item he/she is most likely to buy.\n",
    "    - Rank each item according to how many similar customers purchased it.\n",
    "    - Or rated by most\n",
    "    - Or highest rated\n",
    "    - Or some other popularity criteria.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>Negative points of recommendation system</b>\n",
    "    - It is called Lazy-Learning.\n",
    "      The calculation start only after new user is registered. Our calculation will not start unless we get new user's data.\n",
    "    - Computationally-Intensive.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>How to reduce computation ?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly sample customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discard Infrequent buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discard items that are very popular or very unpopular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering can reduce number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA can reduce number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>A critical limitation of Collaborative Filtering \"Cold Start\":</b>\n",
    "    - How to create recommendation for new users.\n",
    "    - How about new items.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>How to address Cold Start ?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>New Users:-</b>\n",
    "    - Popular items (get quick reaction of the users)\n",
    "    - Demographically relevent items\n",
    "    - Browsing History\n",
    "    - Secondary Source of data --- social network, subscirption\n",
